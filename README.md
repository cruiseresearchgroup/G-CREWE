In The 29th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, 2020.
## Prerequisites
* numpy
* pandas
* networkx 2.3
* tensorflow 1.13.1 with keras-applications and keras-preprocessing
## Framework
It is flexible for the propopsed framework to apply different a compression method or node embedding method for network alignment. Two compression and embedding learning methods are available in the code.
